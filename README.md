ytdwn
--
a command line interface (CLI) implementation of pytube.
For first use it is recommended to run 
```
py main.py addcmd ytdwn
```
then it will generate a .BAT file that can be executed via .\ytdwn (or whatever you want, just replace ytdwn in the cmd with your adjusted name). ADD THIS TO PATH FOR GLOBAL USAGE.

General Execution
--
for general execution of the file type (if you have a bat script replace py main.py with your bat's name.)
then add the paramaters download, then any flags, then the url.
for example:
```
py main.py download -hq https://youtube.com/...
```
hq will download the video as high quality. if not provided, first stream avaliable will be chosen.
This is AGAINST youtube's TOS, account suspension, while unlikely, is a possibility. By using this program you accept these dangers.
Thank you.
